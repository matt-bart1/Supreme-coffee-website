                <h2>ABOUT <span id="second"> US</span></h2>
                <p>Opened in 1996 in the heart of Manchester, Supreme Coffee had one mission: to bring the very best coffee in the world to the hardworking people of the greatest city on Earth. 22 years later we have succeeded in that mission. Our coffee menu now consists of blends from 36 different countries and we have established ties with farms who practice ethical trading, ensuring the coffee you buy will be helping someone less fortunate.
                 <br><br> Our ambitions don't stop there though. We have expanded our expertise into food and other drinks. Our tea selection now consists of blends from 15 countries and our chefs are all michelin star rated. <br><br>
                we are dedicated to our customers and providing the best drink experience we possibly can.   </p>
